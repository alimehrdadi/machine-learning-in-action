steps:
1. import data: often comes in a csv file.
2. clean data
3. split data into training and test.
4. creat a model: selecting an algorithm to analyze the data. there are so many machine learning alg e.g. neural network, decision trees and so on.
5. train the model.
6. make predictions.
7. evaluate and improve: maybe we need to get back to our model and either select a different alg.
